## - There are two methods to measure gene expression: DNA micro array and RNA sequencing

## - DNA Mirco array sample preparation. RNA is extracted from both samples (normal and tumour samples). Rna is transcribed into cDNA using the reverse transcription method. During this process, cDNA from both samples are labelled with different fluorescent molecules. The microarray plate has many spots/holes, each embedded with multiple short probes (oligonucleotide of target Gene X). cDNA from both samples are allowed to hybridize to their complementary probes on the microarray, then microarray is washed and the amount of fluorescence received from each spot and sample indicates the expression level of the corresponding gene.
